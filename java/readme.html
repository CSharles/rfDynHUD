This is the help readme for rfDynHUD and the rfDynHUD Editor.
</p>

<p>
rfDynHUD means rFactor Dynamic HUD. (Please don't call it &quot;That new TV-Style&quot; or something like that.)<br />
It is a new, feature rich, configurable and extendable dynamic HUD system for rFactor. It is configured through
ini files, which are created and modified using the provided editor, which is kinda self-documentary. Please read the following
clauses carefully. We will happily answer all your questions, if you got some, but please avoid asking things explained here.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Configuration files - overlay.ini</strong><br />
The &quot;config&quot; folder contains rfDynHUD configuration files.
</p>

<p>
The plugin supports individual configurations for each mod, car and session and even specific ones for being in the garage.
If no specific configurations are found, the default configuration will be used. This default configuration is expected in
the &quot;config&quot; folder under the name &quot;overlay.ini&quot;. Use the editor to create a valid configuration of your
preference.
</p>

<p>
Mod-specific configurations are searched for in subfolders named like the mod. So if you want to create a specific config for the
&quot;F1CTDP06&quot; mod, you have to save the config file in a subfolder of the config folder called &quot;F1CTDP06&quot;
and config file is to be named &quot;overlay.ini&quot;.
</p>

<p>
If you want to use an individual configuration for a car, which's class is called &quot;CarClass&quot; of the Mod &quot;MyMod&quot;,
the config file must be stored as &quot;MyMod\overlay_CarClass.ini&quot;.
</p>

<p>
To use session-type specific configurations, you have to insert the session type identifier into the name as the last part.<br />
Valid identifiers are:
<ul>
    <li>TEST_DAY</li>
    <li>PRACTICE1</li>
    <li>PRACTICE2</li>
    <li>PRACTICE3</li>
    <li>PRACTICE4</li>
    <li>PRACTICE</li>
    <li>QUALIFYING</li>
    <li>WARMUP</li>
    <li>RACE</li>
</ul>
PRACTICE is a wildcard for PREACTICE1, PRACTICE2, etc.
</p>

<p>
Please refer to the log file to know the names of the mod and car, if you don't already know them.
</p>

<p>
The search order, if the mod is &quot;F1CTDP06&quot; and the car is &quot;F1 2006&quot; and the session type is &quot;PRACTICE3&quot;,
is the following:
<ol>
    <li>F1CTDP06\overlay_garage_F1 2006_PRACTICE3.ini</li>
    <li>F1CTDP06\overlay_garage_F1 2006_PRACTICE.ini</li>
    <li>F1CTDP06\overlay_garage_PRACTICE3.ini</li>
    <li>F1CTDP06\overlay_garage_PRACTICE.ini</li>
    <li>overlay_garage_PRACTICE3.ini</li>
    <li>overlay_garage_PRACTICE.ini</li>
    <li>F1CTDP06\overlay_garage_F1 2006.ini</li>
    <li>F1CTDP06\overlay_garage.ini</li>
    <li>overlay_garage.ini</li>
    <li>F1CTDP06\overlay_F1 2006_PRACTICE3.ini</li>
    <li>F1CTDP06\overlay_F1 2006_PRACTICE.ini</li>
    <li>F1CTDP06\overlay_PRACTICE3.ini</li>
    <li>F1CTDP06\overlay_PRACTICE.ini</li>
    <li>overlay_PRACTICE3.ini</li>
    <li>overlay_PRACTICE.ini</li>
    <li>F1CTDP06\overlay_F1 2006.ini</li>
    <li>F1CTDP06\overlay.ini</li>
    <li>overlay.ini</li>
</ol>

The &quot;_garage&quot; block is skipped, when leaving the garage.
</p>

<p>
If none of them could be found, the built-in factory default configuration is used. 
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately we had to use a unique vehicle class for all cars for the &quot;CTDP F1 2006&quot; mod. So this mod doesn't support
special configurations for any car.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Configuration files - three letter codes</strong><br />
The &quot;config&quot; folder also contains the three letter codes configuration file used by the StandingsWidget and others.
This file keeps mappings for known driver names to short forms (not necessarily 3 letters), that can be displayed instead
to save some room on the screen. The file is accessed as &quot;three_letter_codes.ini&quot; and has entries of the form:
<pre>
Rubens Barrichello=BAR
Michael Schumacher=Mich
Pedro De La Rosa=DLR;P. d.l.Rosa
</pre>
As you can see you can also separate a second short form by a semicolon from the actual three letter code. This short form is
normally generated. But for some names it can be usefull to define it yourself.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Configuration files - input bindings</strong><br />
Another file, searched for in this folder, is the &quot;input_bindings.ini&quot;.
It keeps mappings of key-strokes or button-presses to input actions on named Widgets.
Use the InputBindingsManager from within the editor to generate and maintain that file.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Editor - Different backgrounds</strong><br />
You can change the editor background images, so that they look like you use to see your rFactor. Do this by creating one screenshot
for each of the resolutions, that you see under the &quot;Resolutions&quot; menu (menu bar). If you're lazy, just create a screenshot for the
resultion, that you want to use in the editor. But we encourage you to create a complete set of screenshots and send them to us, so
that we can provide them as additional downloads.<br />
After you created those screenshots copy them to a new folder under the editor\backgrounds folder in the plugin folder. There you'll
find a folder called &quot;default&quot;, which contains the default screenshot-set. Now select the new set from the properties editor
to the right after deletecting any Widget.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Editor - Basic workflow</strong><br />
<p style="margin-top: 0;">
Add a new Widget by selecting an entry from the Widgets menu.
</p>
<p>
Remove a widget by selecting it with the mouse and then either pressing the DELETE key or choosing the &quot;Remove selected Widget&quot; entry
from the Widgets menu (last item).<br />
</p>
<p>
Position or scale a Widget by either dragging it resp. its borders with the mouse or by changing the appropriate properties in the
properties editor on the right side of the editor.<br />
Positions and sizes can either be given in absolute pixels or percentages. Only use pixels, if you're creating a private configuration
and never plan to switch your game resolution.<br />
If you want to share your new configuration, you must use percentages for both position and size. Otherwise your configuration will
look different on different screens and resolutions.<br />
You can change the default, that is used when a new Widget is created in the options window.
</p>
<p>
All other properties are only configurable through the properties editor. Select a Widget with the mouse and then modify the
properties as you like. Every single property is documented. So if you want to know more about a specific property, select it in the
properties editor and the description will be displayed in the panel below.
</p>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Templates</strong><br />
It is possible to define templates for any Widget type. This is simply done by storing a Widget configuration file containing
one Widget of any kind. Then select the configuration file for the &quot;templateConfig&quot; property in the property editor to the right
after deselecting any Widget.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Screenshots</strong><br />
You can create screenshots from your currently displayed configuration. Select &quot;Take Screenshot&quot; from the &quot;Tools&quot;
menu. This will create a new image file in your &quot;UserData\ScreenShots&quot; folder.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Have fun! :-)</strong><br />
