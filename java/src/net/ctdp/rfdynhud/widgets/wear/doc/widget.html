<p>
The <strong>WearWidget</strong> renders wear/health information.
</p>

<p>
<strong><u>Engine</u></strong><br />
The engine lifetime (wear/health) is displayed both as a bar and as a percentage value.
The normal green (right most) part of the bar is the safe lifetime range. The engine will (or should) never fail within that range.
When the normal green part has gone, the percentage value will show 0.0%.
If the engine has a lifetime variance (random range), it is displayed as a light green part of the bar (engine should only fail here in rare cases)
yellow part (engine will fail within that range in most cases) and a red part (engine will fail here in rare cases only).
While the bar is within the variance parts the percentage value will become negative.

<p>
<strong><u>Tires</u></strong><br />
The upper value is the absolute wear. The lower value (in parentheses)
is the grip in percent and the bar shows the normalized grip.
The red line in the bar shows the wear again.
</p>

<p>
<strong><u>Brakes</u></strong><br />
The brake bars show a green and red part again. This has the same meaning as for the engine.
