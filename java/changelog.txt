v1.0.0 - 1.0.1

* Fixed 30-50 seconds freeze when switching back on the plugin when started with AI control.
* Fixed redraw bug for the MapWidget and TrackPositionWidget.
* Fixed item coloring of the MapWidget and TrackPositionWidget.
* Added flag to StandingsWidget to show/hide the Laps/Stops column.
* Added some random topspeeds to the Editor display.
* Absolute pixels for position and size properties are now displayed with a "px" postfix.
* Position and size properties can now be entered without units. Current units are used then.
* Tweaked (default) font color for the StandingsWidget entry for the own car to be more different to the others.
* ETVTimingWidget has a "displayType" property now instead of the "alwaysVisible" one, that enables you to make it visible only if the current lap is not an outlap.
* MiscWidget now shows the "Leader" also in the first lap.
* Added low-fuel warning image (blinking) to FuelWidget.
* Added estimated (at the end of the race) engine lifetime marker to the WearWidget.
* Moved readme.html from the config folder to the root plugin folder.

v1.0.1 - 1.1.0

Major:

* Added support for rendering the overlay on the session monitor views.
* When observing other vehicles the HUD displays data for this vehicle (as much as available).
* Some Widgets are now auto-hidden when switching to AI control, since the rFactor Plugin interface doesn't give data for them in that case.
* Added a localizations system (translations).
* Added support for imperial units.
* Added MapWidget rotation according to the current vehicle's heading.
* Added sector specific colors to MapWidget.
* MapWidget/TrackPositionWidget: draw important positions last.
* Added vehicle class relative scoring (configuration global option).
* Added support for timed races (estimate max laps, calculate lifetime).
* Improved early rendering of Widgets to reduce the gap when entering the cockpit.
* Added padding properties.
* Added rfdynhud.ini as central plugin configuration file to support localizations and custom config folders, etc.
* RevMeterWidget: Rev limit from setup is now used. This enables you to actually use rev markes fixed in the background image.
* RevMeterWidget: Digital max revs can now be boost level dependent.
* Added pause detection.
* Added a data cache to restore fuel usage and fastest lap times per mod, car and track.
* Added support for multiple displays.
* Added SpeedoWidget.
* Added AssembledWidget to combine existing Widgets to create a new and more complex one in an efficient way.
* Added support for images to style the ETV Widgets. Images are made by Daniel Zemla.

Minor:

* Fixed laptimes to be properly displayed after finishing the race.
* Added a "No Border" button to the border selector. (Simply sets the selected border alias to an empty string)
* Dirty flag is now set when the %/px button is pressed for position and size properties.
* Positioning property is now properly modified when dragging a Widget around. This also fixes the inability to move a centered Widget to the left or right boudary.
* Added multiple visibility flags to properly handle visibility.
* Improved StandingsWidget update frequency to only update when things can have changed.
* Fixed clear rectangles for drawn strings (fixes very small StandingsWidgets).
* Max revs are now handled better to improve the workaround for an rf-plugin-interface bug.
* The Widget name is now applied to the InputBindingsManager when a Widget is doubleclicked (instead of selection change).
* An image can now be selected in the ImageSelector through a double click.
* When adding a new Widget, it is now added to the center of the current viewport instead of absolute top left.
* Editor: New magnet/rail effect (theoretically replaces the grid, but I left it in).
* StartingLightWidget's visibility handling changed. Make sure, initialVisibility is on, if you don't plan to toggle it with an InputAction.
* StartingLightWidget is now auto-sized based on the number of lights (track dependent).
* RevMeterWidget: When the background image is changed, positions and sizes of elements are adjusted.
* Moved border configurations from config/images/borders to config/borders
* When saving a new configuration in the editor (Save As), a filename construction utility helps you to construct the correct filename.
* Widgets menu in the editor looks nicer with small Widget icons.
* Added a basic RideHeightWidget.
* Added support for key combinations and hit counts for input bindings.
* Added peak needle to the RevMeterWidget.
* Tweaked rendering code to allow for overlapping Widgets.
* Sub textures are now properly drawn in the editor.
* Editor takes less memory now and doesn't consume any more than necessary.
* Added a FuelNeedleWidget.
* Added Widget import tool.
* Added Editor Panel zooming (CTRL + Mouse Wheel).
* Added a way to select Widgets in background in the editor (context menu). Selections are also better preserved.
* Added a management system for log files to archive a given number of log files for reference. See rfdynhud.ini 'numArchivedLogFiles'.
* Added DashboardWidget.
* Added ETVTelemetryWidget (Revs, Velocity, Trottle/Brake).

TODO:

* Meta config (merge configurations)
* Add master d3d9.dll
* General profiling to tweak performance
* Fix/Improve clock frequencies

* Improve viewed vehicle detection (use me if close, read from application)
* Render plugin in replay mode (theoretically not possible, needs application memory access)
* MapWidget/TrackPositionWidget: Display pace car (impossible, not in VehicleScoringInfo)
